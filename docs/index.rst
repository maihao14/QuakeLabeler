Welcome to SeisLabelCreator's documentation!
============================================

SeisLabelCreator (SLC) is a package containing Python tools for labelling
earthquake data (for machine learning applications). Current functionalities
include retrieving waveforms from data centers, customizing seismic samples,
auto-preparing datasets for training, testing and validation, preprocessing
and augmenting techniques, and visualizing data distribution. The code helps
all levels of AI developers and researchers for querying and building their
own earthquake datasets and can be used through an interactive command-line
interface with little knowledge of Python.
