Welcome to QuakeLabeler's documentation!
============================================

Quake Labeler (QL) is a Python package that enables you to label ground truth seismic phase arrivals for various machine learning applications. Current functionalities include retrieving raw waveforms from online data centers, customizing automation modules, processing and augmenting data, annotating by online reviewed earthquake catalogues, and visualizing data distribution. The code helps all levels of AI developers and researchers build their own machine learning earthquake datasets. Currently, Quake Labeler runs on an interactive command-line interface so that you can create datasets in a fast and efficient way. By design, Quake Labeler enhances reproducibility in AI seismic research.
